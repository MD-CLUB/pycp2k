# Setup directories and mpi parallelization. If you specify a working directory
# and a project name, the output and input file names and the
# GLOBAL.Project_name keyword are automatically generated for you. You can
# alternatively specify each separately. You can setup the cp2k command with
# calc.cp2k_command, and the mpi command with calc.mpi_command.  MPI can be
# turned on or off with calc.mpi_on (on by default). The -n flag can be setup
# with calc.mpi_n_processes. Any special flags can be specified by using
# calc.cp2k_flags or calc.mpi_flags. By default cp2k is run in the output
# directory, but you can change the working directory with
# calc.working_directory.

# Fill input tree. Section names are in upper case, keywords are capitalized.
# Most IDEs will be able to automatically suggest the entries as you begin
# typing them. Relevant parts of the documentation have been copied to
# parsedclasses.py and some IDEs provide quick access to them (e.g. in spyder
# you can search documentation for keyword with the command "go to definition"

# The keywords can entered as any python type that converts to string (int,
# float, etc.). Additionally you can provide non-repeatable keywords as lists.
# In that case the each list element is converted to string, separated with
# white space and printed into input file. Repeatable keywords can also be
# defined as lists, but in this case each list item corresponds to a new
# repeated item. For an example of these features see examples/example_qmmm.py.

# Atoms object created earlier. As arguments these two functions take the
# subsys where the entries should be created and the Atoms object from which
# they are exctracted.
